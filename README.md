# CryptoVerse

The web tool is one of my early React and Rest API projects. I used  React Hook such as useState, useContext, and Redux in this tool. 

The website holds information about top cryptocurrency and crypto news 
It shows the current status of some of the most popular cryptocurrencies worldwide. You can see the historical data of the selected crypto in a chart. You can also find the latest crypto-related news. 

I have used API from the most popular public API hub - https://rapidapi.com/hub.
